## About

Hey! I'm Barbara, passionate about the data world, technology, and animals. I have over 3 years of experience as a Data Analyst in International companies in Mexico and France. I have a technical background and a hold Master of Science degree in Applied Mathematics (Ecole Polytechnique d'ingénieur d'Université Côte d'Azur, France) and other in Business Administration.
The curiosity and communication developed during these years and my creativity, solving problems with a fresh perspective brought me to Data Analytics. I enjoy drilling into data and coming up with a big insight that fuels the development of a strategy for the people, companies or someone who needs to solve a problem. 
This repository tells you more about my skills and projects that show my progress and my improvements in Data Analytics/ Data Science related topics.
